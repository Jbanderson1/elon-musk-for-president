                For our P33 project we teamed up with M1 to bring awareness to and teach about an economic issue that many people face. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Which is that: many potential electric car owners are scared off by the high initial cost when compared to the standard gas car but what we know and want to teach is that owning an  
                electric vehicle is a longterm investment and that overtime the economic benefits become a lot more apparent when compared to the overtime cost of a standard gas car. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thus our goal for this project became to create a java program that will show you the overtime cost of owning an electric vehicle and an HTML website that can teach others important facts about electric vehicles.

    		        The most common <b>Electric vehicle</b> is a <b>Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV)</b>. These are solely powered by electricity and use a large battery pack that supplies energy to an electric motor (or multiple motors) to power the vehicle.
    		        Another type are <b>Hybrid vehicles</b> which also use electric motors, but in combination with gasoline engines to power the car. Two similar but different types of hybrids exist: the <b>Plug-In-Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</b> and the 
    		        <b>Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)</b> the difference between the two is that a PHEV's battery can be charged by being plugged in and is typically larger than the battery pack of a hybrid. While the HEV cannot be plugged in and instead 
    		        uses the gasoline engine to recharge the battery pack.

    		    <div class="text">
    		        The difference in cost between owning and operating an electric car compared with a gasoline car is very different. There are several factors you'll need to think about like the cost of fuel, maintenance and the overall purchase price of 
    		        the vehicle itself.
    		      <h3>Cost to Charge</h3>                 
                   The average annual cost of charging an electric vehicle in America is $755, referred to as the egallon, compared to the average refill cost for a gas car which is $1,615. 
                   But these prices will vary by state so make sure to research specific prices yourself. Also the EPA estimates that the electric Kia EV6, for instance, would cost $550 to 
                   fuel over the course of a year, while the gas-powered Kia K5 would cost $1950 to fuel. This estimate is based on driving 15,000 miles per year and current fuel and 
                   electricity prices, and assumes all charging happens at home
                    <br>
                    <br>
    		      <h3>Driving Range</h3>
        		   Many of today's EVs are estimated to go over 300 miles on a charge, and fast-charging capabilities allow you to regain a significant number of miles in a matter of minutes. 
        		   But long-distance drives may still require some planning, as you'll have to figure out where charging stations are along your route and how long you'll have to stop to replenish the battery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  <h3>Maintenance Costs</h3>
                    Electric vehicles also tend to have lower maintenance costs, as electric motors and batteries require less routine care than gasoline engines do. They don't need regular oil changes but you do need auto insurance, tire rotations, and 
                    brake maintenance. For the Tesla Model 3 the annual cost of maintenance is $190 a year. For the United States most popular gas car, the Toyota Rav 4, its cost of maintenance is $964.60.

    		        Electric vehicles can be charged either at home with a personal EV charger or at a public EV charging station which are more common in ubran cities than other areas. The price of using the EV charger might vary as well
    		        some public EV stations allow people to charge for free but others do charge and since their is no set price it varies between stations with the average cost of electricity.
    		        The electricity that powers EVs can come from a variety of sources. Electricity is produced from burning gas or coal, or from renewable sources such as hydropower, wind, or solar. 
                    Electricity prices vary depending on whether you charge at home or whether you charge at public charging stations. Some energy companies also charge more for using electricity at peak hours.
